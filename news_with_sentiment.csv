I had the pleasure of speaking at the West Linn Historical Society’s Ignite event, where I shared a whirlwind tour through the last 30 years of search history.

So, here it is—my full script: 1,034 words that capture the evolution of search — from dusty reference books, to AI-driven everything. Enjoy the ride! If you’re Gen X or older, you may remember researching school projects at the library. We actually had to leave the house back then to find information!

The increased prices can squeeze real wages, impacting consumer spending, with reduced profits and policy uncertainty weighing over business investments.

External forces like trade policies mean companies have limited leeway on how to protect themselves. “Tariffs, like any crisis, are extremely dynamic — and the latest round that imposed tariffs on all U.S. importers is a perfect example,” Leagh Turner, CEO of Coupa Software, told PYMNTS. “They impact businesses in different ways depending on their country, product type and trade relationships. That makes it difficult for leaders to predict the full impact to their business.” But artificial intelligence (AI) can help, despite the daily turbulence.

The challenge isn’t just nailing the lip sync — it’s making facial expressions and body language move in tandem.

I felt Demis Hassabis was trustworthy in a way Sam Altman couldn't be—a true scientist, not a businessman. Also, AlphaGo and AlphaZero. To me, they're not historical milestones but nostalgia. ChatGPT is cool, but do you remember move 37? And the AlphaZero-Stockfish 8 chess games? My love and interest for AI grew parallel to DeepMind’s successes. I was rooting, almost like a sports fan, for them. So, for years, I’ve been low-key saddened by their constant fumbling. They had the tech, the talent, the money, the infrastructure, the prestige, and the conviction to make ChatGPT—or whatever else they wanted—before OpenAI. They didn't. CEO Sundar Pichai was afraid to thwart Google’s main revenue source (search and ads). He chose prudence over boldness. Good—they didn’t shoot themselves in the foot. Because they didn’t shoot at all.

Worse, the new product directly competes with the original workers.

Additionally, 9 buffer overflows in parsing SquashFS, EXT4, CramFS, JFFS2, and symlinks were discovered in U-Boot and Barebox, which require physical access to exploit. The newly discovered flaws impact devices relying on UEFI Secure Boot, and if the right conditions are met, attackers can bypass security protections to execute arbitrary code on the device. Nothing major here. These aren’t exploitable out of the box. But that an AI system can do this at all is impressive, and I expect their capabilities to continue to improve.

This company is only a few months old, and employs just a handful of people. There are no products yet. So, why would investors put in so much money and value such a young enterprise at around $10 billion? I think there are two main explanations. Both are based on how venture capital works in the age of generative AI and Big Tech. First up: This is a very expensive option on Mira's startup working out spectacularly well. If that happens, a $10 billion valuation could become $100 billion. Or $1 trillion. OpenAI, where Murati used to work, was recently valued at $300 billion. Google is worth almost $2 trillion.

The following has been edited for length and clarity. I began my career as a software design engineer in 1999, working at various technology companies in Boston and San Francisco. In 2008, my wife and I took a year off to travel the world and it was eye-opening. In 2009, we relocated to Colorado and I founded a content management software company, Kapost. I was the CTO and grew the business for nine years until it was acquired by Upland for $50 million in 2019. As a major shareholder, I was happy with my share of the proceeds. Following the acquisition, I worked as the cofounder and CTO for Onward, an assisted transportation marketplace in California. I helped scale the business until it was acquired in the summer of 2021. After a lengthy career in tech, I felt ready for a change. At 42, my family and I left Colorado for Portugal. My wife and I wanted a slower pace of l...",POSITIVE,0.9965053796768188,1

Technology to detect these signals has ranged from electrodes and patches to watches. Now, an innovative wall-mounted technology is capable of monitoring vital signs. Advanced TeleSensors Inc. developed the Cardi/o Monitor with an exclusive license from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. Over the course of five years, NASA engineers created a small, inexpensive, contactless device to measure vital signs, a challenging task partly because monitoring heart rate requires picking out motions of about one three-thousandth of an inch, which are easily swamped by other movement in the environment. By the late 1990s, hardware and computing technology could meet the challenge, and the NASA JPL team created a prototype the size of a thick textbook. It would emit a radio beam toward a stationary person, working similarly to a radar, and a...",NEGATIVE,0.9691451191902161,-1

And if there was one thing to take away from Trump’s carefully crafted stunt, it’s that he believes Americans don’t want fancy penthouses or desk jobs. Americans want to work in the coal mines, according to the president. “One thing I learned about the coal miners is that’s what they want to do,” Trump said. “You could give them a penthouse on Fifth Avenue and a different kind of a job and they’d be unhappy. They want to mine coal, that’s what they love to do.” Trump made this assertion while making fun of his 2016 presidential rival Hillary Clinton, who he said wanted coal miners to get other jobs making “widgets and gadgets and technology, which they didn’t want to do.” The president, clearly still obsessed with an election from 9 years ago, said that Clinton wanted these same people to make phones. “She was going to put ...",NEGATIVE,0.9805148839950562,-1

In an interview with Nintendo Life, Nintendo of America VP of product development and publishing Nate Bihldorff said the Joy-Con 2 are ânot Hall effect sticks.â Hall effect joysticks rely on an electrical conduction technology that allows them to remain out of contact with other components.

The wolves were created by genetically editing the DNA of gray wolf cells to more closely resemble that of a dire wolf; this edited DNA then served as the basis for embryos implanted in surrogate dogs.

In December 2024, the price was raised to $325, but it has now been cut back to $250.In a note to investors seen by AppleInsider, Wedbush analysts described the current situation facing Apple as a ""tariff economic Armageddon,"" and ""a complete disaster.""

Even before this increase, and even before Trump announced his initial tariffs, Apple took steps to minimize the hit it expected to face. That was said to consist of stockpiling iPhones, having five flights full of them head for the States ahead of Trump's deadline. Now according to Nikkei Asia, Apple was far from the sole technology company doing this —  and it wasn't only importing iPhones. While details are sketchy, the publication claims that Apple, Dell, Microsoft, and Lenovo all shipped their most premium devices to the States.
